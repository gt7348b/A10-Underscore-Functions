## A10 - Recreate JS Underscore functions

This project will recreate several underscore functions using only javascript and place in a special library called "roscoe".

The following were recreated and are in the file john.js in the apps/scripts file:

_.filter  =  roscoe.filter
_.reject  =  roscoe.reject
_.map     =  roscoe.map
_.last    =  roscoe.last
_.first   =  roscoe.first
-.reduce  =  roscoe.reduce

If you'd like to use this library
 - Clone my repo
 - Run npm install
 - Run bower install


There are no known licenses need for this project.
